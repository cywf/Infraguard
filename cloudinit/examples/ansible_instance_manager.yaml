#cloud-config
#
# A common use-case for cloud-init is to bootstrap user and ssh
# settings to be managed by a remote configuration management tool,
# such as ansible.
#
# This example assumes a default Ubuntu cloud image, which should contain
# the required software to be managed remotely by Ansible.
